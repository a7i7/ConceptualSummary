It was a time when I was working in Chennai, staying in a PG, when I got rashes on my palm and feet and swollen lymph nodes all over my ear and neck. I did a research about my symptoms on the net and got so scared knowing the different possible conditions that I might have got. So I asked my sister, a doctor who was in her final year of MD at that time, with a hope that she'd diagnose it correctly. But there she was sounding like she couldn't care less. She coolly said that it should be some kind of allergy and would get cured on its own. But I was sure that it had to be something more critical than just allergy. So I went behind her back and consulted a doctor myself. It was a well renowned hospital and the doctor looked quite old and experienced. I showed him the symptoms and that's it, he got so shocked and shouted at me for not consulting a doctor soon enough. He doubted that it could be a type of TB and gave me a list of tests to be done the next day. That was when I realized that my instincts were right and at that moment I hated my sister more than anyone else in the world. I mean how could she be so ignorant !! I came out of the hospital with teary eyes, called my sister and blasted at her, who by the way was still pretty sure that it was an allergy. Huh?? seriously !!! Then I called up my dad, asked him to come to Chennai the very next day, underwent all the tests which costed him a fortune :( Then I was made to meet an infection specialist with all the test results who finally declared that I have a skin allergy and asked me to take rest for a few days and sent me back. That is it. no tablets, nothing!! Just imagine how embarrassed i would have felt when I faced my sister after that. The first thing that she said was, 'So..Sahana.. tell me how long did the doctor say that you'll live?' I was like eeeeeeeeee.
Lesson learnt: Always trust your sister :)
